# StatisticalAnalysis
Pulled a statistical analysis on customer data where predicted values of gender also used to come to a conclusion.

This analysis answers the question like
  1. Which are the most valueable customers (finding top 10 customers)?
  2. What is the trend of order by weeks?
  3. Is there a significant difference between two genders with respect to their order count?
  4. What is the quality of predictor model which predicted gender on buying patteren?
